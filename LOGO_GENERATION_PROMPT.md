# AI Templates Logo Generation Prompt

Use this prompt with AI image generators (Gemini, DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)

---

## Core Prompt

Create a modern, abstract logo for "AI Templates" - an open-source project that provides production-ready building blocks for AI applications.

**Symbolic Meaning (Not Literal):**
The logo should evoke:
- **Building blocks** and modularity (templates you compose together)
- **Open collaboration** and community (open source ecosystem)
- **Innovation and intelligence** (AI-powered development)
- **Reliability and professionalism** (production-ready, enterprise-grade)
- **Growth and possibility** (empowering developers to build faster)

**Visual Style:**
- **Modern minimalism** - Clean, simple, memorable
- **Geometric** - Sharp, precise shapes (not organic/flowing)
- **Abstract** - Symbolic rather than literal (no gears, circuit boards, robots, brains)
- **Scalable** - Must work from 16px (favicon) to 512px (high-res)
- **Timeless** - Should feel current in 5+ years

**Color Palette:**
Primary options (choose one approach):
1. **Gradient:** Purple to blue (#667eea → #764ba2) - represents intelligence and innovation
2. **Accent:** Teal/green (#11998e → #38ef7d) - represents open source and growth
3. **Monochrome:** Single color with transparency - maximum versatility
4. **Duo-tone:** Purple + teal combination

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Format:** SVG (vector) preferred, or high-res PNG (2048x2048+)
- **Background:** Transparent
- **Safe area:** Design should work in circular or square crop
- **Icon-friendly:** Recognizable even without text
- **Print-ready:** Works in black & white if needed

## Design Direction Examples

### Approach 1: Geometric Composition
Abstract shapes that suggest modular building - overlapping squares, interlocking forms, or nested elements. Think of how templates compose together.

*Evokes:* Modularity, composition, building blocks  
*Example feel:* Like Kubernetes logo but more abstract, or Tailwind CSS

### Approach 2: Connection Network
Abstract nodes and connections forming an intelligent pattern. Suggests how templates connect agents, servers, and UIs together.

*Evokes:* Connectivity, ecosystem, collaboration  
*Example feel:* Like Gatsby logo or React's atomic symbol, but network-focused

### Approach 3: Growth Pattern
Organic but geometric growth - like crystalline structures or fractal patterns. Represents how developers build and scale from templates.

*Evokes:* Growth, scalability, natural emergence  
*Example feel:* Like Vercel's triangle or Stripe's geometric forms

### Approach 4: Portal/Gateway
Abstract portal or doorway shape - templates as gateways to building AI applications faster.

*Evokes:* Access, enablement, transformation  
*Example feel:* Modern, architectural, forward-looking

## What to AVOID

- ❌ Literal AI imagery (robot faces, brains, neural networks)
- ❌ Generic tech clichés (gears, circuits, binary code)
- ❌ Overly complex designs (won't scale to small sizes)
- ❌ Trendy effects that will date quickly (3D, heavy gradients)
- ❌ Text-dependent designs (logo must work without "AI Templates" text)
- ❌ Multiple small elements (will blur at favicon size)

## Modern Logo Best Practices

### Shape
- **Single unified form** or max 2-3 large elements
- **Distinct silhouette** - recognizable in thumbnail
- **Balanced** - works in square, circle, or horizontal format
- **Memorable** - distinctive enough to recognize at a glance

### Color
- **Limited palette** - 1-3 colors maximum
- **High contrast** - works on light and dark backgrounds
- **Meaning** - colors should support the concept
- **Flexibility** - provide monochrome version

### Execution
- **Vector-first** - scalable to any size
- **Clean edges** - crisp, precise lines
- **Negative space** - use space intentionally
- **Grid-based** - optically balanced and aligned

### Testing
- View at 16x16px (can you recognize it?)
- View in grayscale (does it still work?)
- View upside down (is it still balanced?)
- View next to competitors (is it distinctive?)

## Context About the Project

**AI Templates** is an open-source ecosystem providing:
- **MCP Servers** - Extend AI agent capabilities
- **AI Agents** - LangGraph-based intelligent workflows  
- **UI Components** - Chat interfaces for AI applications

**Values:**
- Production-ready (not just demos)
- Developer-friendly (make AI accessible)
- Community-driven (open source collaboration)
- Modular (compose what you need)
- Enterprise-grade (security, scalability)

**Target Audience:**
- Developers building AI applications
- Platform engineers
- Open source contributors
- Technical leaders

**Brand Personality:**
- Professional but approachable
- Modern but not trendy
- Powerful but not intimidating
- Collaborative but not corporate

## Example Prompts to Try

### For Gemini/DALL-E:
> "Create a minimalist, geometric logo for 'AI Templates', an open-source developer platform. Use abstract, interconnected shapes to suggest modularity and composition. Clean lines, modern aesthetic. Purple and teal gradient. Must be simple enough to work as a 16px favicon. Vector style, flat design, no gradients on shapes themselves. Think Stripe meets Kubernetes - professional, geometric, memorable."

### For Midjourney:
> "minimal geometric logo, abstract interlocking shapes, developer tools brand, purple and teal colors, flat design, scalable icon, negative space, modern tech aesthetic, vector art, clean lines --style raw --v 6"

### For More Abstract:
> "Create an abstract symbol representing modular AI building blocks. Geometric forms that suggest connection and growth. Single unified shape. Purple gradient. Modern, minimalist, professional. Must work at tiny sizes. No literal AI imagery."

## Evaluation Criteria

When you get logo options, ask:

1. **Does it scale well?** (Test at 16px, 64px, 512px)
2. **Is it distinctive?** (Would you recognize it in a sea of logos?)
3. **Does it fit the brand?** (Modern, professional, open-source feel?)
4. **Will it age well?** (Timeless or trendy?)
5. **Does it work everywhere?** (Light bg, dark bg, monochrome?)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Generate options** - Try 3-5 different concepts
2. **Test at scale** - View at different sizes
3. **Get feedback** - Show to team/community
4. **Refine** - Iterate on the best option
5. **Finalize** - Create SVG + PNG versions
6. **Deploy** - I'll help you swap it into the site!

Good luck! Let me know when you have a candidate and I'll help integrate it.
