# About AI Templates

AI Templates are production-ready components for building AI applications on Kubernetes. This open source project provides battle-tested templates that help teams go beyond demos and proofs of concept to real, deployable AI systems.

## About the Logo

The AI Templates logo draws inspiration from the **Königsberg bridge problem**—the puzzle that launched graph theory in 1736 when Leonhard Euler proved it was impossible to walk through the city of Königsberg crossing each of its seven bridges exactly once.

The logo's interconnected nodes and edges pay homage to this foundational problem in mathematics and computer science. Just as Euler transformed a practical problem about bridges into abstract graph theory, AI Templates transforms the complexity of AI infrastructure into reusable, modular components.

The graph structure in our logo represents:
- **Nodes** as the modular templates (MCP Server, Agent, UI)
- **Edges** as the connections and data flows between components
- **The traversal path** as the journey from concept to production

This mathematical heritage reflects our commitment to principled, well-architected solutions built on solid foundations.

## Project Goals

- **Accelerate AI Development** - Get from idea to production in hours, not weeks
- **Enterprise-Ready** - Built-in security, authentication, observability from day one
- **Open Source** - Apache 2.0 licensed, community-driven development
- **Kubernetes-Native** - Deploy anywhere containers run
